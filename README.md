# dev-glossary
C++ program to study flash cards typically related to computer science, information technology, and programming languages.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the Google IT program with Coursera for providing wide lists of IT terminologies. 

# Usage
To use, run the executable with the name of the glossary you would like to use. for example, `./a.out it1.txt` automatically loads the glossary into memory when executed.

Running the exectuable without a parameter prompts you with a menu, asking what you would like to do.
